# Ans 1 :  Multithreading in Python is a technique that enables multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. In simple words, the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently is known as multithreading. It allows efficient and easy communication between the threads. Multithreading is used to achieve multitasking and is particularly useful in scenarios where a program involves tasks that are I/O-bound and spend much of their time waiting for external events.
# 
# Python provides two built-in modules for implementing multithreading programs: the threading module and the _thread module. The threading module provides a very simple and intuitive API for spawning multiple threads in a program. It constructs higher-level threading interfaces on top of the lower level _thread module. The _thread module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads

# activeCount(): This function returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. The returned count is equal to the length of the list returned by enumerate(). Here’s an example
# 

# In[4]:


import threading
print(threading.activeCount())


# Ans2 : The threading module in Python is used for creating, controlling, and managing threads1. It allows you to run multiple pieces of code at the same time, which can be useful for tasks that take a long time to run, such as networking, file I/O, or computationally intensive tasks. It provides a very simple and intuitive API for spawning multiple threads in a program.

# currentThread(): This function returns the current Thread object, corresponding to the caller’s thread of control46. If the caller’s thread of control was not created through the threading module, a dummy thread object with limited functionality is returned. Here’s an example:

# In[5]:


import threading
print(threading.currentThread())


# enumerate(): This function returns a list of all Thread objects currently active. The list includes daemonic threads, dummy thread objects created by currentThread(), and the main thread. It excludes terminated threads and threads that have not yet been started4. Here’s an example:

# In[6]:


import threading
print(threading.enumerate())


# Ans 3 : here are the explanations for the functions you asked about:
# 
# run: The run function is typically used in the context of threads in programming languages like Java and Python. It contains the code that needs to be executed when a new thread is started. In Python, for instance, you define a run method in a class that extends Thread, and the code inside this method is what gets executed when you start the thread.
# 
# start: The start function is used to begin the execution of a thread. When you call start, it initiates the thread’s run method in a separate thread of control. It’s important to note that you should never call the run method directly. Instead, you should call start, which in turn calls run.
# 
# join: The join function is used to make a calling thread wait until the called thread finishes its execution1. This is useful when a thread’s computation depends on the result of another thread. In SQL, JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. In Python, the join method is used to concatenate all elements in an iterable into a single string.
# 
# isAlive: The isAlive function checks if a thread is still running. It returns true if the thread is alive (i.e., it has been started and has not yet finished execution), and false otherwise

# Ans 4 : Program to print the square and cube 

# In[7]:


import threading

# Function to print squares
def print_squares():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'Square of {i} is {i**2}')

# Function to print cubes
def print_cubes():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'Cube of {i} is {i**3}')

# Creating threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)

# Starting threads
t1.start()
t2.start()

# Wait until both threads finish
t1.join()
t2.join()


# Ans 5 : Sure, here are some advantages and disadvantages of multithreading:
# 
# **Advantages**:
# 1. **Responsiveness**: Multithreading can allow an application to remain responsive to input. In a single-threaded environment, if the main execution thread blocks on a long-running task, the entire application can appear to freeze. By moving such long-running tasks to a worker thread that runs concurrently with the main execution thread, it is possible for the application to remain responsive to user input while executing tasks in the background.
# 2. **Resource Sharing**: By default, threads share the memory and the resources of the process to which they belong. The benefit of sharing code and data is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
# 3. **Economy**: Allocating memory and resources for process creation is costly in terms of time and space. Since threads share memory with the process they belong to, it is more economical to create and context switch threads.
# 4. **Utilization of Multiprocessor Architectures**: The benefits of multithreading can be greatly increased on multiprocessor architectures, where threads may be running in parallel on multiple processors.
# 5. **Improved Server Responsiveness**: In a server environment, multithreading can enable you to serve multiple clients concurrently, thereby improving responsiveness.
# 
# **Disadvantages**:
# 1. **Increased Complexity**: Multithreaded programs can be more complex and difficult to design, understand, and debug than single-threaded ones.
# 2. **Overhead**: Thread creation and synchronization can incur significant overhead. Context switching between threads also adds overhead and can decrease performance.
# 3. **Difficulty in Debugging and Testing**: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging since issues can arise from race conditions or synchronization errors, which are hard to reproduce and predict.
# 4. **Potential for Deadlocks**: Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are blocked waiting for resources held by each other, causing the program to freeze or crash.
# 5. **Security Concerns**: Multithreaded programs can have security concerns such as race conditions and memory leaks, which can lead to data corruption and other vulnerabilities.
# 
# 

# Ans 6 :
# 
# 1. **Deadlocks**¹²³: A deadlock is a situation where a set of processes or threads are blocked because each process or thread is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process or thread. For example, consider two trains coming toward each other on the same track. There is only one track, so none of the trains can move once they are in front of each other. Deadlocks can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously:
#     - **Mutual Exclusion**: Two or more resources are non-shareable (Only one process can use at a time).
#     - **Hold and Wait**: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources.
#     - **No Preemption**: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource.
#     - **Circular Wait**: A set of processes waiting for each other in circular form.
# 
# 2. **Race Conditions**⁶⁷⁸⁹: A race condition is a condition of a program where its behavior depends on relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes. One or more possible outcomes may be undesirable, resulting in a bug. This kind of behavior is referred to as nondeterministic. Problems often occur when one thread does a "check-then-act" (e.g., "check" if the value is X, then "act" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the "check" and the "act".
